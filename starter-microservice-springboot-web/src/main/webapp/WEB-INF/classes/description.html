	<h2>Spring Boot with Spring REST</h2>
	<p>Inside the project there is a application.springboot.web package
		containing two classes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>SpringBootLibertyApplication</code>: The entry point for the SpringBoot application.</li>
		<li><code>LibertyHelloController</code>: A Spring REST endpoint which you can access at <a href="springbootweb">/springbootweb</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is also a test class named <code>it.springboot.web.HelloControllerTest</code> that will test the Spring REST endpoint to ensure it is working.</p>
