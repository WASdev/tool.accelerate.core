	<h2>Swagger</h2>
	<p>
		Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of RESTful APIs. 
	<p>
	<p>
		Discover REST APIs that are available on the Liberty server and then invoke the found REST endpoints using the <a
			href="../ibm/api/explorer">Swagger user interface</a>. (Username and password are specified in the server.xml)
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also easily expose the REST endpoints available from your web modules running on Liberty server by documenting the endpoints using the Swagger 2.0 Specification. 
		It is also possible to follow a design-first approach by creating the Swagger documentation first and then generating the server code from it.
