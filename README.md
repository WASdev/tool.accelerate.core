# Welcome to the [Liberty app accelerator](https://liberty-app-accelerator.wasdev.developer.ibm.com/start/) 
An application builder to allow you to construct starter Java applications that run on [WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/).

## Summary
Liberty app accelerator has been taken down.

You can still generate Liberty applications for the cloud through [IBM Cloud Developer tools](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli) or [IBM Cloud UI](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/appservice/starter-kits).

The Liberty starters provided by Liberty app accelerator have been uploaded to Maven Central and can still be used in your projects.
